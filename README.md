# Conventional Commit

A Rust parser library for the [Conventional Commit] spec.

## Work in Progress

The parser does not 100% conform to the spec yet, and since the spec is still in
beta, it is likely to still introduce some changes.

Once the spec hits 1.0, and the parser is fully compliant, this library will be
tagged with `v1.0.0` as well.
